  <t>
    When a client is granted a write delegation on a file, it is the authority
    for the file. If another client wants to know the size
    of the file, it queries the server, which in turn uses a CB_GETATTR
    to query the client which holds the delegation (see Section 20.1 of
    <xref target='RFC5661' />. For either the access or modify time,
    the server need not query the client with the delegation.  When
    the client returns the delegation via a DELEGRETURN (see
    section 18.6 of <xref target='RFC5661' />), it need not update the
    attributes to the server.
  </t>

  <t>
    If the server is a metadata server, it may have to query the
    storage devices for the access and modify times of the data
    file. If we let A1 and M1 be the respective access and modify
    times of the data file when the file was opened, then the access
    and modify times on the metadata file can be calculated by the
    difference of the final times on the data file.
  </t>

  <t>
    With a server is a proxy for a NFSv4 server, it is a client
    to the NFSv4 server and during file I/O, it may get a delegation
    on a file. The client of the proxy would be querying the
    proxy for attributes and not the NFSv4 server.
