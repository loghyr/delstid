    If a file is archived or offline, it metadata portion
    is available to the file server, but the data content is
    not available.  Thus a compound with a GETATTR or READDIR
    can report the file's attributes without bringing the
    file online.  However, either an OPEN or a LAYOUTGET
    might cause the file server to retrieve the archived
    data contents, bringin the file online.  If an operating
    system is not aware that the file is offline, it might
    inadvertantly open the file to determine what type of
    file it is accessing. (cite Windows and Mac Finder).

    By adding the new attribute FATTR4_OFFLINE, a client
    can predetermine the avaiablity of the file, avoiding the
    need to open it at all. Note that being offline might
    also mean that the file is archived in the cloud, i.e.,
    there can be an expense in both retrieving the file
    to bring online and in sending the file back to offline
    status.
