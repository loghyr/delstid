    &lt;CODE ENDS&gt;
  </t>

  <t>
    <xref target="RFC8178" /> (see Section 4.4.2) allows for extending
    the microversion of the NFSv4.x protocol without increasing the
    microversion.  The client can probe the capabilities of the server
    and based on that result, determine if both it and the server support
    features not specified in the main microversion documuent.
  </t>

  <t>
    The XDR extensions presented in this section allow for the OPEN
    procedure to be extended in such a fashion. It models all of the
    parameters via bitmap4 data structures, which allows for the
    addition of a new flag to any of the OPEN arguments (see Section
    18.16.1 of <xref target="RFC5661" />. Two new flags are provided:
    <list style='symbols'>
      <t>OPEN4_SHARE_ACCESS_WANT_OPEN_XOR_DELEGATION (see Section <xref target='sec:proxy' />)</t>
      <t>OPEN4_SHARE_ACCESS_WANT_DELEG_TIMESTAMPS</t>
    </list>
    Subsequent documents can use this framework to introduce
    new functionality to OPEN.
  </t>

  <t>
    This section extends the OPEN procedure to allow it to return
    either an open or delegation stateid. The file is said to be "open"
    to the client as long as the count of open and delegated stateids
    is greater than 0.  Either type of stateid is suffucient to
    keep the file open, which allows READ, WRITE, LOCK, and LAYOUTGET
    operations to proceed. If the client gets both a open and a
    delegation stateid as part of the OPEN, then it has to return
    them both.  And during each operation, the client can send
    a costly GETATTR.
  </t>

  <t>
    If the client knows that the server supports the
    OPEN4_SHARE_ACCESS_WANT_OPEN_XOR_DELEGATION flag (as determined
    by an earlier GETATTR operation which queried for the
    FATTR4_OPEN_ARGUMENTS attribute), then the client can
    supply that flag during the OPEN and only get either
    an open or delegation stateid.
  </t>

  <t>
    The client is already prepared to not get a delegation stateid
    even if requested. In order to not send an open stateid,
    the server can indicate that fact with the result flag
    of OPEN4_RESULT_NO_OPEN_STATEID. The open stateid field,
    OPEN4resok.stateid (see Section 18.16.2 of <xref target="RFC5661" />,
    should also be set to the special all zero stateid.
  </t>
